What is the why, how, and what of the UX Design practice?

![Quote](/hugo-quickstart/Purple.png)

*Why we do what we do*: We envision a world where everybody who uses the products and services we create or improve gets what they need and enjoys doing it.

*How we do it*: We take a human-centered approach to design. That means we seek to deeply understand the people weâ€™re designing for by talking to them and observing what they do and keeping them at the center of the creation process.

*What we do*: We apply the practices of UX design (including research, interpretation, ideation, prototyping) alongside our teammates and stakeholders to co-create useful, usable, and delightful experiences.
