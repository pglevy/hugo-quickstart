At the end of 2019, the Social Security Administration (SSA) invited Bixal and a few other small businesses to participate in a 48-hour design challenge with the goal of identifying a partner to evaluate and improve methods in which the public completes SSA's self-service transactions online.

Bixal's performance led to us being selected to perform this important work for the SSA and we're incredibly excited about the opportunity to work with them to positively impact the lives of the people that the SSA serves.

The SSA used an innovative approach to quickly assess vendor capabilities, prompting challenge participants with a problem statement to conduct research and deliver a prototype for the Seattle Public Library (SPL), providing a comparable design task to complete within the limited timeframe:

> _"The City of Seattle has seen rapid growth in the last ten years, with a combined population increase of 22% since 2010. The Seattle Public Library is looking to engage these thousands of new residents at a rate relative to the yearly growth of the city. To start, the Library want[ed] to understand the existing pain points for signing up for a library card and hopes that improving the process can kickstart increased engagement."_

We assembled a cross-functional team of user experience (UX) researchers and designers, content strategists, data analysts, visual designers, and customer experience (CX) experts to illustrate the wide range of skills Bixal brings to our projects. We had two days to understand the problem, define the audience, synthesize our research, and prototype solutions!

#### Discovery and Research

Following our team brief, we collectively defined a research plan and then split up into several workstreams and embarked on a series of user testing and analogous interviews of our own team members with relevant experiences, local librarians, and librarians from the SPL.

We also studied analytics from the SPL website to develop an initial picture of audience demographics and better understand the issues relating to usability, customer experience, and engagement for new Seattle residents. Through this process, we discovered common pain points, as well as gained a deeper understanding of how people currently interact with the library.

Our research efforts centered around the primary needs and end goals for intended audience, which we broke down into six (6) featured personas:

1. Job-seeking audience,
2. Retirees,
3. Families with children,
4. People with unique needs,
5. Financially challenged individuals, and
6. Lifelong learners.

We then challenged ourselves to think more holistically about how we could interact with these audience groups in the process of considering taking action to help them realize the opportunities and benefits that are available through the library. The team identified 4 key insights, or areas of opportunity:

* Libraries require some basic accountability by being able to contact people who are borrowing items, but in general they are very open about making their services and materials available to the public;
* People who are not already avid readers may not think of the library as the place to go for all the other programs and services they offer;
* For new residents, there are a number of touchpoints they go through that provide opportunities for raising awareness about what the library has to offer; and
* The digital experience of signing up for an SPL card is not consistent with the openness and flexibility of the in-person experience. There are numerous usability issues that cause confusion and prevent access.

#### Defining the User Needs

At this stage, we determined through analytics and audience research––coupled with our secondary research (e.g., talking to individuals that matched our audience personas, reviewing the website, and viewing multimedia related to the library)––that a common theme among our personas began to emerge, which helped us focus on specific groups that had overlapping qualities.

We began to explore possible future experiences to test our hypotheses and decided to focus on a single audience that allowed us to tell a compelling story by diving deeper into the persona through empathy mapping. By developing an empathy map the team was able to have a better sense of the motivating factors behind key decision points.

The retiree persona made a good candidate for this exercise because they had the potential for a broad set of interactions with the library and this enabled us to explore a storyline that included engagement with the library through multiple channels, including traditional mail, e-mail, online media, and eventually in-person.

In an effort to test our assumption that many of the actions of the retiree would be similar to other audiences, we developed a journey map that highlighted various user stories using the traditional format, "As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >" including:

* As a retiree, I want to be close to my daughter and her family, so that I can spend more time with them and my grandchildren.
* As a retiree, I want to explore fun and interesting activities in the area, so that I can involve my grandchildren.
* As a retiree, I want to find tools and services, so that I may connect with other persons in my area with similar interests.
* As a retiree I want a place to access the internet, so that I may take advantage of state and local services.
* As a retiree, I want assistance in navigating complex information and forms, so that I can feel confident I am completing them correctly.

Our goal was to showcase our human-centered design research process––which is supported through defined human needs, strong data, and holistic research––to the SSA, demonstrating how we arrived at the proposed solution, and show why it was this was best option to engage our selected audience.

#### Designing the Prototype

Once our research was complete, we explored possible scenarios and built a variety of visual prototypes to test our hypotheses and started with a storyboard to envision a complete experience from beginning to end.

The prototypes included a welcome packet for new residents, informing them about the library and all it has to offer, as well as streamlining the registration process with an effortless digital sign-up experience where users could simply enter a code for immediate online access to the library's catalog.

Our findings also indicated that new residents who become library patrons often lose interest and reduce their participation in library activities over time. During a future initiative, we recommended developing engagement campaigns to generate excitement around events and engage new residents.

Future prototype suggestions included targeted social media engagement, ongoing and personalized messaging, and surveys to learn more about new residents and their interests.

Through these efforts, Bixal was selected as the winner of the design challenge and will continue working with the SSA on some new and exciting challenges! This was really an amazing team effort and a fantastic display of our research process.<br>
