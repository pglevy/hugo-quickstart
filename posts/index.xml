      <description>Approach &amp;amp; Mindset The golden circle What is the why, how, and what of the UX Design practice?
Why we do what we do: We envision a world where everybody who uses the products and services we create or improve gets what they need and enjoys doing it.
How we do it: We take a human-centered approach to design. That means we seek to deeply understand the people weâ€™re designing for by talking to them and observing what they do and keeping them at the center of the creation process.</description>
